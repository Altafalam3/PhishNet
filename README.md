PhishNet is more than just a typical website; it's your vigilant guardian in the vast landscape of the internet, specifically tailored for the security-conscious user. Designed with simplicity and effectiveness in mind, PhishNet is your go-to tool to discern the safety of the links you encounter.

## Motivation

In a world where cyber threats are omnipresent, We wanted to create a platform that empowers users to navigate the web securely. Phishing, a deceitful practice of mimicking trustworthy entities to obtain sensitive information, is a prevalent danger. PhishNet not only identifies potential phishing links but takes it a step further by allowing users to actively contribute to its evolving database.

## How PhishNet Works

PhishNet employs cutting-edge technology to analyze links and determine their safety. The user-friendly interface is complemented by a Chrome extension for seamless integration into your browsing experience. A unique feature is the ability to report a link as phishing if it slips through the initial detection, enhancing the collective defense against evolving threats.

## User Incentives and Rewards

To encourage active participation in making the internet a safer place, PhishNet offers a reward system. Users earn rewards for reporting phishing links, contributing to the community's knowledge, and maintaining a vigilant cyberspace. The leader board showcases the top contributors, fostering a sense of community and healthy competition.

## Typosquatting Feature

PhishNet doesn't just stop at phishing. It also includes a typosquatting feature that alerts users to potential threats from domains with similar spellings to popular websites. This proactive approach adds an extra layer of protection against deceptive online practices.

## Subscription Model

PhishNet understands the diverse needs of users and offers a subscription model. Subscribers enjoy additional benefits, including an increased number of link analyses, priority access to new features, and an ad-free experience. This model ensures sustainable growth and continuous improvement of the platform.

## Feedback-Driven and Evolving

Just as threats in the cyber realm adapt, so does PhishNet. User feedback is the cornerstone of its development. I am committed to continuously refining PhishNet based on the insights and experiences shared by its users. This ensures that the platform stays ahead of emerging phishing tactics.
